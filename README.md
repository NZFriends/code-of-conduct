# Mission Statement
NZFriends goal is provide a safe and welcoming environment for adults in New Zealand to form real life friendships.

## Statement
These guidelines should and will change. Nothing is set in stone and there will be situations not covered. The intent is to outline what is broadly (un)acceptable so we all have something to point at.

Constructive feedback is important, valuable, and appreciated. Everyone on staff and even in the community can voice when they want change or disagree. As long as it's productive and not harping on. At some point it is just complaining.

What is good for the community may or may not be good for the individual or even a particular group. The community should cater to many different groups of people with many different interests to encourage diversity.

Decisions ultimately rest with server owner.

## Staff Code of Conduct
1. Respect eachother.
   - We can disagree privately, but being part of staff means everyone else on staff has your back.
   - It's ok to be wrong and/or change your mind and no one on staff should be dragging you down.
1. Act professionally.
   - Follow the server rules. You are not above them because you are staff.
   - Do not participate or incite dogpiling, mob mentalities, or random outrage.
   - Do not abuse your position. At all.
     - No misuing bots, granting roles that haven't earned, moving people in VCs for fun, etc.
     - It does not matter if they're your friends or other staff.
     - Moderation functions are for moderation. Nothing else.
1. Take action.
    - In being a member of staff you are expected to take action to maintain the community.
    - Don't just simply complain or be grumpy in `#staff-chat`. You literally have the power to do something. Ask the team if you're unsure. If the consensus is yes, then take the action.
    - You **MUST** add case notes for any action you take. This is so people other than you can understand what happened.
1. Maintain a publicly acceptable environment.
   - People are here to find real life friends. Treat it like an in person public space.
   - Use your judgement. If it's not against the rules or NZ law, it should generally be allowed.
     - > Need to come back to this to reword. We're a private space and can and should provide a better space than what is simply "legal". Example: Politics are a valid discussion, but if they break the polite harmony of the server then they are not in our best interests to forming friends.
1. Ask for help & call each other out privately.
    - See #1. Respect eachother.
    - No one has to know all the answers.
    - If a member of staff is not following the code of conduct, call them out privately or in `#staff-chat`. Use your discretion and escalate if necessary.

## Taking action
Do. Not. Dogpile.

Any mod on the team is singularly capable of enforcing the rules. Unless someone asks for help, let the staff who raised it deal with it.

* As fellow staff your job is now to help the community move on by changing the topic or direction of the conversation.
* This includes ensuring that others in the server do not continue attacking the individual breaking the rules.
* Enable slow chat if people are not listening or time out others for shorter durations.

### Moderators
* Warn
    1. Warn verbally.
       * Distinguish yourself as a mod (use mute if appropriate) and ask someone politely to stop. Explain what rule they're breaking.
    2. Warn formally. Use the bots.
       * This allows individual staff to be removed from an individual enforcement action and adds notes to users so other staff can see they've already been warned. We can't all keep track of every action every other mod is taking. We aren't all present 100% of the time.
* Mute/timeout
    * Muting someone will isolate them into the `#muted` channel so the acting staff can discuss the problem with the individual.
    * If the person continues to be beligerant/argumentative consider [timing them out](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/4413305239191-Time-Out-FAQ). Users can't talk, react, or join voice channels. Let them stew for an hour, a day, or a week.
    * > When people are arguing or upset they often lash out. While abusing staff is not ok, no one likes being pulled aside and some offhanded and rude comments should be expected. You've got some laundry to do, right? Tell `#staff-chat` what's happening and don't get baited into an argument. Come back later.
    * > Take. Your. Time. You already warned them. Now they're isolated from the community. At this point they're harmless to you and anyone else in the community. Let them cool off. Cool off yourself. Ask another member of staff to take over if necessary.
* ~~Kick~~
    * > Actually at the moment I don't see huge value in kicking. Maybe use it for people who are stuck in a verification channel so they can rejoin. If someone hasn't listened to warnings even after being muted, then a ban is probably more appropriate.
* Ban
    * Decide how long a ban should be. Ask for advice if you're not sure.
    * > Currently I think we ban permanently a bit too much, but that might just be because there are so many trolls that it feels lopsided.
    * > New users: I generally don't take kindly to people who join and immediately break the rules, especially with NSFW content or advertising (including referral links). While I'd love them to join the community, it's highly likely that they aren't interested in participating anyway. For example why we block Temu for anyone without the `Safety` role.

### Admins
With the addition of the above, admins are empowered to officially warn moderators for any of the above using the same methods as warning other users.

## Losing your positon
If any of these guidelines are not being followed, there is a risk of losing your position. Warnings may or may not being given based on the severity.

Similarly, someone losing a staff position does not indicate they did something wrong. Admins and the server owner should favor being discreet with staffing decisions. Someone may simply not have the time, energy, or inclination to remain on staff.

All staff are expected to not discuss staffing decisions publicly to allow anyone to rejoin the wider community.

An `Almuni` role may exist in the future.
