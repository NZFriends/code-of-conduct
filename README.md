# Mission Statement
NZFriends goal is provide a safe and welcoming environment for adults in New Zealand to form real life friendships.

## Statement
These guidelines should and will evolve. Nothing is set in stone and there will be situations not covered. The intent is to outline what is broadly (un)acceptable so we all have something to point at.

Constructive feedback is important, valuable, and appreciated. Everyone on staff and in the community can voice when they want change or disagree with something. Feedback needs to be productive, thought out and contribute to the betterment of the server environment. If something has already been addressed by the admin of the server, repetitive comments on the topic without alternative solutions can be considered unproductive.

What is good for the community may or may not be good for the individual or even a particular group. The community should cater to many different groups of people with many different interests to encourage diversity.

Decisions ultimately rest with server owner.

## Staff Code of Conduct
1. Respect each other.
   - We can disagree privately, but being part of staff means everyone else on staff has your back.
   - Changing your mind or realising you have the wrong stance on something is okay. No staff member should make you feel otherwise.
   - If a member of staff is not following the code of conduct, call them out privately or in `#staff-chat`. Use your discretion and escalate to admins or owner if necessary.
1. Act professionally.
   - Follow the server rules. You are not above them because you are staff.
   - Do not participate or incite dogpiling, mob mentalities, or random outrage.
   - Do not abuse your position. At all.
     - No misusing bots, granting roles that haven't earned, moving people in VCs for fun, etc.
     - It does not matter if they're your friends or other staff.
     - Moderation functions are for moderation. Nothing else.
1. Maintain a publicly acceptable environment.
   - People are here to find real life friends. Treat it like an in person public space.
   - Use your better judgment. If it isn't against the server rules, Discord's terms of service and doesn't toe the line of criminal activity, it should be allowed, provided the discussion remains respectful and appropriate.
1. Take action.
    - In being a member of staff you are expected to take action to maintain the community rules as outlined in the rules channel.
    - Failing to take action on an issue but complaining about it is neither fair to other staff members nor conducive to a healthy team environment. You have moderator abilities so are expected to act on issues as appropriate. If you are unsure, ask the team. If the consensus is yes, then take the action.
    - You **MUST** add case notes for any action you take. This is so people other than you can understand what happened.
        * You can use the Discord kick/ban functions, which will auto-create a case for you to update.

## Taking action
Do. Not. Dogpile.

Any mod on the team is singularly capable of enforcing the rules. Unless someone asks for help, let the staff who raised it deal with it.

* As fellow staff your job is now to help the community move on by changing the topic or direction of the conversation.
* This includes ensuring that others in the server do not continue attacking the individual breaking the rules.
* Enable slow chat if people are not listening or time out others for shorter durations.
* Use muting or timeouts as part of the warning process. Especially if someone is being argumentative or difficult.
    * [Timeout (Discord FAQ)](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/4413305239191-Time-Out-FAQ): Users can't talk, react, or join voice channels. They will also be disconnected from existing voice channels they're participating in.
    * Mute: This will isolate a user into the `#muted` channel so the acting staff can discuss the problem with the individual.

### Admins
With the addition of the above, admins are empowered to officially warn moderators for any code of conduct issues.

## Losing your positon
If any of these guidelines are not being followed, there is a risk of losing your position. Warnings may or may not being given based on the severity.

Similarly, someone losing a staff position does not indicate they did something wrong. Admins and the server owner should favor being discreet with staffing decisions. Someone may simply not have the time, energy, or inclination to remain on staff.

All staff are expected to not discuss staffing decisions publicly to allow anyone to rejoin the wider community peacefully.

An `Alumni` role may exist in the future.
